# History

By rethinking MVC and GUI during using React, I developed the need of writing animations with declarative code. It was late 2014. I created the first prototype with CoffeeScript but it's not viable. In early 2016, I rewrote it with ClojureScript, which is last version of Quamolit. Now it's being rewritten in calcit-js.
